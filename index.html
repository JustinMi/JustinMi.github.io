    <h1>Hi there, I'm Justin!</h1>
    <p> My name is Justin Mi, and I'm a freshman EECS major at UC Berkeley. I love coding and solving tricky problems. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me listening to hip hop albums, browsing fashion blogs, or debating strangers on online hip hop and fashion forums. This site is nominally a professional portfolio and personal blog, but in reality its a personal website that I use to document various parts of my life.</p>
    <!-- <p>Below are some of the personal blog posts that I have enjoyed writing the most:</p> -->
    <p> My favorite languages to code in are Python and Java, but am willing to use whatever language is needed to finish the job. I also have a soft spot for <a href="https://xkcd.com/297/">Lisp</a>. I am doing a lot of web development work right now, so I am growing fonder of Python and Django by the day. </p>
    <p> My workflow and production stack: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Hardware</b>: Macbook Pro, with a second monitor; a cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BP5KOPA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">mouse-and-keyboard combo from Amazon</a></li> <!-- blog post: why macs are good -->
      <li> <b>Text editor</b>: Sublime/Vim </li>
      <li> <b>Virtual servers</b>: AWS, ex-Digital Ocean user </li>
      <li> <b>Prefered web dev stack</b>: LAMP with Rails, but MEAN is growing on me  </li>
      <li> <b>Auxiliaries</b>: git, LastPass, Google Drive, Slack </li>
      <li> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/themieberlake/playlist/6tFhfrZCiRvwzfP7Y8onUW"><b>Playlist I use when I want to get work done</b>:</a> </li>
