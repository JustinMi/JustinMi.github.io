      I'm an EECS major at UC Berkeley, and some of my favorite things include skating, sushi, and hip hop.

    <p>
      I am a project lead for <a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/">Blueprint</a>, a campus organization that aims to provide well-designed and beautiful engineering for those who create social good. In addition, I am an undergraduate researcher and systems administrator for <a href="http://autolab.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley's Automation Lab</a>, where I worked on <a href="http://citris-uc.org/connected-communities/project/the-collaborative-assessment-and-feedback-engine-cafe/">an open-source platform to create responsive and engaging surveys for legislators</a>. Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I converted Stripe's $3B+ global Instant Payouts infrastructure volume to a new vendor, saving over $1M+ annually and achieving nearly 100% uptime and stability for clients like Lyft, Instacart, Postmates, and Care.com.

      In the past, I was a lead undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute of Data Science</a>, working on a project to use machine learning to identify invasive species, as well as a TA for Berkeley's <a href="http://datastructur.es/">Data Structures and Algorithms</a> course.
