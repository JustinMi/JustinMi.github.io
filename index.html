    <h1>Hi there, I'm Justin Mi!</h1>
    <p> I'm a freshman EECS major at UC Berkeley. I love coding and solving tricky problems. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me listening to hip hop albums, browsing fashion blogs, or debating strangers on online hip hop and fashion forums. This site is a mixture of a professional portfolio and a personal blog.</p>
    <!-- <p>Below are some of the personal blog posts that I have enjoyed writing the most:</p> -->
    <p> My favorite languages to code in are Python and Java, but am willing to use whatever language is needed to finish the job. Oh, yeah, I also have a soft spot for <a href="https://xkcd.com/297/">Lisp</a>. I am doing a lot of web development work right now, so I am growing fonder of Python and Django by the day. </p>
    <p> My workflow and production stack: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hardware: Macbook Pro, with a second monitor; a cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BP5KOPA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">mouse-and-keyboard combo from Amazon</a></li> <!-- blog post: why macs are good -->
      <li> Text editor: Sublime/Vim (Atom? What's Atom?) </li>
      <li> Virtual servers: Digital Ocean, for their great documentation, UX, and community </li>
      <li> Prefered web stack: LAMP, but MEAN is growing on me  </li>
      <li> Auxiliaries: git, 1Password, Google Drive </li>
      <li> Playlist I use when I want to get work done: <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Athemieberlake%3Aplaylist%3A6tFhfrZCiRvwzfP7Y8onUW" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe> </li>
    </ul>
