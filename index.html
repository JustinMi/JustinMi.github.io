    I studied EECS at UC Berkeley, and some of my pet passions include
    architecture, economics, and classic rock/blues. I currently work at a
    <a href="https://www.appliedintuition.com/"
      >Applied Intuition</a
    >, a startup building software infrastructure to safely develop, test, and
    deploy autonomous vehicles
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, I worked at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> where I
    worked on Instant Payouts, and at
    <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> where I worked on the data
    infrastructure team.

    At Cal, I was a member of
    <a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/">Blueprint</a>, a campus organization
    that works with nonprofits to build thoughtful web and mobile apps for
    social good. I also worked as an undergraduate researcher and systems
    administrator for
    <a href="http://autolab.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley's Automation Lab</a>, where
    I worked on
    <a
      href="http://citris-uc.org/connected-communities/project/the-collaborative-assessment-and-feedback-engine-cafe/"
      >an open-source platform to create responsive and engaging surveys for
      legislators and policy makers</a
    >. In addition, I was a TA for Berkeley's
    <a href="http://datastructur.es/">Data Structures and Algorithms</a> course.

    This past summer I worked as a software engineering intern at
    <a href="https://enterprise.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>. There, I built
    a detailed data pipeline monitoring service and dashboard for all of
    engineering's data processing jobs across Databricks, AWS, and proprietary
    frameworks, giving product and sales teams reliable SLAs for banner clients.

  <p>
    In the past, I've also worked as a software engineering intern at
    <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I converted Stripe's $4B+
    global Instant Payouts infrastructure volume to a new partner, saving over
    $1M+ annually and achieving nearly 100% uptime and stability for clients
    like Lyft, Instacart, Postmates, and Doordash.
