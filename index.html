    <h1>Hi there, I'm Justin!</h1>
    <p> My name is Justin Mi, and I'm a sophomore EECS major at UC Berkeley. I love coding and solving tricky problems. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me listening to hip hop albums or browsing fashion blogs. This site is nominally a professional portfolio and personal blog, but in reality its a personal website that I use to document various parts of my life.</p>
    <!-- <p>Below are some of the personal blog posts that I have enjoyed writing the most:</p> -->
    <p> My favorite languages to code in are Python and Java, but am willing to use whatever language is needed to finish the job. I also have a soft spot for <a href="https://xkcd.com/297/">Lisp</a>. I am doing a lot of web development work right now, so I am growing fonder of Python and Django by the day. </p>
    <p> My workflow and production stack: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Hardware</b>: Macbook Pro, with a second monitor; a cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BP5KOPA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">mouse-and-keyboard combo from Amazon</a></li> <!-- blog post: why macs are good -->
      <li> <b>Text editor</b>: Sublime/Vim </li>
      <li> <b>Virtual servers</b>: AWS, ex-Digital Ocean user </li>
      <li> <b>Prefered web dev stack</b>: LAMP with Rails, but MEAN is growing on me  </li>
      <li> <b>Auxiliaries</b>: git, LastPass, Google Drive, Slack </li>
      <li> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/themieberlake/playlist/6tFhfrZCiRvwzfP7Y8onUW"><b>Playlist I use when I want to get work done</b>:</a> </li>
