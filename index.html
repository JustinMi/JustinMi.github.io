    I study EECS at UC Berkeley, and some of my favorite things include
    architecture, design, sushi, and guitars.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a member of <a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/">Blueprint</a>, a
    campus organization that works with nonprofits to build thoughtful web and
    mobile apps for social good.
  </p>
  <p>
    This past summer I worked as a software engineering intern at
    <a href="https://enterprise.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>. There, I built
    a detailed data pipeline monitoring service and dashboard for all of
    engineering's Mongo and Databricks jobs, giving product and sales teams
    reliable SLAs for mission-critical clients.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, I've also worked as a software engineering intern at
    <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I converted Stripe's $4B+
    global Instant Payouts infrastructure volume to a new partner, saving over
    $1M+ annually and achieving nearly 100% uptime and stability for clients
    like Lyft, Instacart, Postmates, and Doordash.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher and systems
    administrator for
    <a href="http://autolab.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley's Automation Lab</a>, where
    I worked on
    <a
      href="http://citris-uc.org/connected-communities/project/the-collaborative-assessment-and-feedback-engine-cafe/"
      >an open-source platform to create responsive and engaging surveys for
      legislators and policy makers</a
    >. In addition, I was a lead undergraduate researcher at the
    <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute of Data Science</a>,
    working on a project to use machine learning to identify invasive species,
    as well as a TA for Berkeley's
    <a href="http://datastructur.es/">Data Structures and Algorithms</a> course.
