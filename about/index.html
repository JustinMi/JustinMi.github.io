    <p> 
      My name is Justin Mi, and I'm a sophomore EECS major at UC Berkeley. I love coding and solving tricky problems. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me listening to hip hop albums or browsing fashion blogs. This site is nominally a professional portfolio and personal blog, but in reality its a personal website that I use to document various parts of my life.
    </p>

    <p> 
      My favorite languages to code in are Python and Java, but am willing to use whatever language is needed to finish the job. I also have a soft spot for <a href="https://xkcd.com/297/">Lisp</a>. I am doing a lot of web development work right now, so I am growing fonder of Python and Django by the day. 
    </p>

    <p>
      And if you are at all interested in hip hop, you can check out <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/songs">some songs I currently have stuck in my head</a>

      Below are some of the personal blog posts that I have enjoyed writing the most:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2017/04/28/migrating-sql-databases">Migrating SQLite Databases to MySQL</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2017/05/01/reddit-message">An Interesting Reddit Message</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2017/05/18/connecting-machine-to-wireless-network">Giving Local Network SSH Access to Your Wireless Machine</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
      My workflow and production stack:
