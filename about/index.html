      Hey there, I'm Justin! I'm currently a sophomore EECS major at UC Berkeley, but I've always been a Bay Area kid, born and raised in the South Bay. I decided to build this website because I wanted a way to share some of my thoughts and opinions in a personal blog.  
    </p>

    <p>
      When I am not digging my way out of CS problem sets and projects, I am a lead undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute of Data Science</a>, working on a project to crowd-source data for machine learning on invasive species. In addition, I am an undergraduate researcher and Linux systems administrator for <a href="http://autolab.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley's Automation Lab</a>.
