# Intro

When you make a web app, it may be necessary to have the website be available in multiple languages. One common use case is a webstore--if the webstore offers shipping and processing to multiple countries, it would be helpful make it language- and region-specific by listing items listed in the store in varying languages and currency types. 

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/localization_blog_post/endclothing.png" description="An example of a webstore that offers differing versions of its website depending on the country it is shipping to" style="width=80%" %}

A commonly used term that describes this process is _"localization"_--making your website accessible in another languages, with respect to cultural nuances and differences. You may commonly see it refered to as _"l10n"_, because there are 10 letters between "l" and "n" in "localization". Kind of a weird custom in my opinion, but its widespread and recognizable. Another term related to (and often used in conjunction with) "localization" is _"internalization"_, which is the process of setting up your website codebase in such a way that it supports easy localization. This definition is more fuzzy and big-picture, but generally that entails developing in such a way that makes coding for translations as easy and scalable as possible. "Internalization" is similarly nicknamed _"i18n"_, because there are 18 letters between "i" and "n". Again, kind of a weird nickname, but hey, it works.

Luckily, Django has built-in functionality for localization and internalization that makes it simple to store, update, modify, and display translations. Let's explore how it works!

### Prerequisites/Assumptions: 
* You are using OS X or Linux
* You are comfortable with using Django 1.1 with Python 2.7
* You use `conda` or `virtualenv`

# Overview and Setup

In this tutorial, we will be creating a super simple example page that will display text and have a button that users can click to toggle the text between English and Filipino. To begin, we will setup a new virtual environment using `conda` or `virtualenv`. Commands for `conda`:
```bash
$ conda create --name translate python=2
$ source activate translate
$ pip install Django
```

Commands for `virtualenv`:
```bash
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 translate
$ source translate/bin/activate
$ pip install Django
```

After, we will set up the Django project and `example` app, where we will create our example page as described before:
```bash
$ django-admin startproject translate
$ cd translate
$ python manage.py startapp example
```

Now, we should have a project directory structure that looks something like this:
```
└── translate
    ├── db.sqlite3
    ├── manage.py
    ├── example
    │   ├── migrations
    │   │   └── __init__.py
    │   ├── templates
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── admin.py
    │   ├── apps.py
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── tests.py
    │   └── views.py
    └── translate
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py
```

At this stage, you can run `python manage.py runserver` and navigate to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> to double-check that Django shows its default landing page.

# Creating the Static Page

We will now begin creating our example page. In our templates folder, we will create a very simple `html` file called `translation_example.html` and set it up like so:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>
  <title>Example</title>
</head>

<body>
  Hello world!
  <p>
    This is a paragraph
  </p>
  <p>
    Another paragraph
  </p>
  <p>
    Paragraph, part 3
  </p>
</body>

</html>
```
Plain and simple. As a sneak peek ahead, we will allow users to convert `Hello world!` and the other paragraphs from English to Filipino or vice-versa with a click of a button. 

# Rendering the Page

In order to have the template we just created show up when we enter <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> into our browser, we must edit two files, `settings.py` and `views.py`, as well as create a file, `urls.py`. 

First, we will edit `settings.py` to allow Django to "recognize" the template we just made. In `translate/settings.py`, we will add `os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'example/atemplates')` to `TEMPLATES` so the end result looks like this:
```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'example/templates')],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```
This will let Django know that a known directory that holds templates is at `example/templates`, and it will look there for any relevant templates. 


After that, we will add a method to `examples/views.py` so we have a way for the [Django Controller](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names) to communicate with the template. Edit your `views.py` so it looks like this:
```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return render(request, "translation_example.html")
```
All our `index` function does is make an API call to render the html we just wrote. The function will get a bit more complex than this later, but not by much.
