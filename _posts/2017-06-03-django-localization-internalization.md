# Intro

When you make a web app, it may be necessary to have the website be available in multiple languages. One common use case is a webstore--if the webstore offers shipping and processing to multiple countries, it would be helpful make it language- and region-specific by listing items listed in the store in varying languages and currency types.

A commonly used term that describes this process is _"localization"_--making your website accessible in another languages, with respect to cultural nuances and differences. You may commonly see it refered to as _"l10n"_, because there are 10 letters between "l" and "n" in "localization". Kind of a weird custom in my opinion, but its widespread and recognizable. Another term related to (and often used in conjunction with) "localization" is _"internalization"_, which is the process of setting up your website codebase in such a way that it supports easy localization. This definition is more fuzzy and big-picture, but generally that entails developing in such a way that makes coding for translations as easy and scalable as possible. "Internalization" is similarly nicknamed _"i18n"_, because there are 18 letters between "i" and "n". Again, kind of a weird nickname, but it works. 

Luckily, Django has built-in functionality for localization and internalization that makes it simple to store, update, modify, and display translations. Let's explore how it works!

### Prerequisites/Assumptions: 
* You are using OS X or Linux
* Your website is using Django 1.1 with Python 2.7
* You use `conda` or `virtualenv`

# Overview and Setup

In this tutorial, we will be creating a super simple page that will display text and have a button that users can click to toggle the text between English and Filipino. To begin, we will create and activate a virtual environment using `conda` or `virtualenv`. Commands for `conda`:
```bash
$ conda create --name translate python=2
$ source activate translate
```

Commands for `virtualenv`:
```bash
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 translate
$ source translate/bin/activate
```

Then, we will set up the Django project:
```bash
$ django-admin startproject translate
```
