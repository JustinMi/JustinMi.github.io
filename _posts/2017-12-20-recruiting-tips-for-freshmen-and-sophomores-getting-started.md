# Intro

Recruiting for internships (and clubs, and research positions, and...) as a freshman or sophomore can be daunting at times. Where do you start? How do you apply? How do you maximize your chances of getting responses? How do you "do" a technical interview? This blog post will be the first in a series aimed at freshmen and sophomores that will hopefully answer those questions!

# Part 1: Getting Started

I want to be realistic and honest with you, so first let's get a hard truth out of the way: most companies, unfortunately, are looking for juniors and seniors, because they are hoping that after the internship the interns will sign contracts for full-time positions after graduation. Freshmen and sophomore interns will unlikely sign full-time offers since they have too many years of school left, while juniors and seniors are more likely to sign for full-time.

However, please do not be bummed out! It is still absolutely possible to get an internship as a freshman or sophomore!

Yes, most companies prefer juniors and seniors, but there are a LOT of freshmen-friendly companies out there, and there are even internship programs that *specifically* choose freshmen! Sophomores, you have chances too! Don't worry. I'll go into more detail about those programs later. 

In addition, please keep in mind that across the country, most CS students do not look for internships their freshman or sophomore year, so if you recruit as a freshman or sophomore you are already ahead of the curve! You will be much more experienced by the time you are a junior or senior. 

Hopefully I didn't bum you out too much with those thoughts. If you are still reading, let's get started!

# Your Resume

One thing that every company asks for when considering a job candidate is a resume. If you are looking to create a resume or edit an existing one, I highly suggest starting with an online template--creating your own from scratch is pretty tedious. There are many great LaTeX resume templates out there, like [these](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume) or [this](https://github.com/opensorceror/Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX). If you don't know LaTeX, you can also use Microsoft Word (though you will likely need to learn LaTeX eventually for other Berkeley CS classes, so now is as good a time as any to start learning!). [Here are some great Word templates](https://www.template.net/business/resume/fresher-engineer-resume-template/).
