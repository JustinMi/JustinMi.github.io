# Intro

Recruiting for internships (and clubs, and research positions, and...) as a freshman or sophomore can be daunting at times. Where do you start? How do you apply? How do you maximize your chances of getting responses? How do you "do" a technical interview? This blog post will be the first in a series aimed at freshmen and sophomores that will hopefully answer those questions!

# Part 1: Getting Started

I want to be realistic and honest with you, so first let's get some hard truths out of the way:

  1. Most companies, unfortunately, are looking for juniors and seniors, because they are hoping that after the internship the interns will sign contracts for full-time positions after graduation. Freshmen and sophomore interns will unlikely sign full-time offers since they have too many years of school left, while juniors and seniors are more likely to sign for full-time.
  2. Companies sometimes get thousands of applicants for their internship programs. Depending on the company, the application process can get pretty competitive.
  3. The recruiting process is long. For many companies, there are multiple stages (covered in more detail later). It can sometimes take over a month to get an internship offer (or to even get a response).

Hopefully I did not bum you out too much and you are still reading at this point, because I have some silver linings for each of those points! It is still absolutely possible to get an internship as a freshman or sophomore, for the following reasons:

  1. Yes, most companies prefer juniors and seniors, but there are a LOT of freshmen-friendly companies out there, and there are even internship programs that *specifically* choose freshmen! Sophomores, you have chances too! Don't worry. I'll go into more detail about those programs later. 
  2. Yes, the process can be competitive, but there are ways around the competition that I will share later. And in general, the open spots-to-applicants ratio broadly tends to stay pretty constant across all companies. In other words, you can expect that popular companies will also have lots of open intern positions; less popular companies do not have as many open positions, but then again they likely do not have many people applying anyways. 
  3. Yes, the recruiting process is long, but if you prep well it does not have to take up your entire life! It is very possible to successfully recruit as a "side-activity".
