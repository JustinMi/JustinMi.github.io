# Intro


This is a version of my ["Migrating SQLite Databases to MySQL (Django)"](http://justinmi.me/blog/2017/04/28/migrating-sql-databases) specifically tailored to the PCARI project. 

### Prerequisites/Assumptions: 
* You are using OS X or Ubuntu 16.04
* Your webapp is using Django 1.10.x with Python 2.7
* You have an existing database in SQLite

-------------

# Step 1 (OS X): Downloading and Setting Up MySQL 
_You can skip this step if you already have MySQL set up on your computer._

First, we will download and set up MySQL using [instructions here.](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation.html) I used the [native package installer](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html) rather than the TAR. _Make sure to save the temporary root password they give you!_ Once MySQL is installed, we will [set up a launch daemon that allows MySQL to start up on system/terminal launch](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-launchd.html). 

After you finish installing, double check that your server is running. On Mac OS, you can do this my going to `System Preferences > MySQL`. If not, you can turn it on through that menu.

-------------

# Step 1 (Ubuntu): Downloading and Setting Up MySQL 
_You can skip this step if you already have MySQL set up on your computer or server._

If you are using Ubuntu, you can install using 
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

You will be prompted to set up a root password. Don't forget it, as you will use it later! Then, run the security script to configure MySQL.
```bash
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

To test MySQL is working, enter
```bash
systemctl status mysql.service
```

And you should see an output like
```bash
● mysql.service - MySQL Community Server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: en
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2016-11-23 21:21:25 UTC; 30min ago
 Main PID: 3754 (mysqld)
    Tasks: 28
   Memory: 142.3M
      CPU: 1.994s
   CGroup: /system.slice/mysql.service
           └─3754 /usr/sbin/mysqld
```

If MySQL isn't running, start it using 
```bash
sudo systemctl mysql start
```

-------------

# Step 2: Finshing Up Installation
_You can skip this step if you already have MySQL set up on your computer._

Try running `mysql` in terminal. You might get an error like "command not found". If so, in terminal, configure your computer's `$PATH` so it recognizes `mysql` as an exectutable:  
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/mysql/bin
```  
For me, the command was was  
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin
```  
Check and make sure that your terminal recognizes `mysql` now. You might still get a MySQL specific error, but that's okay--we will fix that in the next steps. 


Unfortunately, this fix only works temporarily. If you open a new terminal tab, you will have to do `export PATH...` again. To allow `mysql` to be a recognizable command every time, we will edit your computer's bash profile. Open the bash profile using your preferred text editor:  
```bash
$ vim ~/.bash_profile
```  
In the file, copy-paste this:  
```bash
# Set architecture flags
export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
# Ensure user-installed binaries take precedence  
export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH  
# Load .bashrc if it exists  
test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc  
``` 
The above code allows `mysql` to be recognized every time. Save the file, restart terminal, and it should work.  

-------------

# Step 3: Creating MySQL Users
_NOTE: in this tutorial, we are altering the root user because it is assumed you do not have any other local users on your MySQL server. If you do, change the usernames accordingly_

Now we are ready to use MySQL! Enter
```bash
$ mysql -u root -p
```
Log in using your root password. If this is your first time logging in, use the password that you saved in step 1. Now, if you want to change the root password to something of your own preference, in the MySQL shell, enter
```mysql
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_new_password';
```
Now, you have your root user set up and can log into it using your own password. 

-------------

# Step 4: Creating the Project Database
Then, to create the database for your project (please be sure to name the database `pcari` to limit conflicts in version control):
```mysql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE pcari CHARACTER SET UTF8;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pcari.* TO root@localhost;
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> QUIT
```

-------------

# Step 5: Changing Django App Settings
Then, install the relevent dependencies in your Python environment using `pip` or `conda`:
```bash
$ pip install MySQL-python
```
If you are using a virtual environment for Python, make sure you have `pip` installed in your virtual environment before using the `pip` commands above, or else the dependencies will be installed globally. 

Finally, in your `settings.py` file in your app, change the `DATABASES` section to the following:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'pcari', #make sure your database name is 'pcari'
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
    }
}
```
A reminder that `your_project_name` should be the same name as the database you created in MySQL in Step 2. `your_password` is the same password that you use to log into MySQL.

We will need to add additional precautions to make sure your MySQL password is secure. We will set your password as an environmental variable, and access your password through the `os` module. 

To allow your own user account to have access to the password, we will edit our `.bashrc` file, which sets system-wide configurations. 
```bash
$ vim ~/.bashrc
```

At the bottom of the file, add
```bash
export mysql_pass="your_mysql_password" # make sure your environmental variable name is mysql_pass
```
This will set `mysql_pass` as an environment variable on your machine permanently.

Then, at the top of `settings.py`, write
```python
import os
```
if it doesn't already exist. We will then change our database configuration to be

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'pcari',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('mysql_pass'),
    }
}
```
And you should be good!

-------------

# Step 6: Make Migrations
We are in the home stretch! Now, all we need to do is apply any migrations you made to the new MySQL database.

Before we do so, however, we also need to edit a migrations so we avoid an error when migrating. Go to `malasakit-v1 > malasakit-django > pcari > migrations > 0039_auto_20161024_1727.py` and and change all the `max_length=30` and `max_length=300 arguments to `max_length=255` which is the conventional amount. This is because some input strings may be more than 30 characters long, so we need to account for that. You can do this in your text editor using any "find-and-replace" commands. 

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/pcari_sql_blog_post/change-max-length.png" description="Change all the max_length attributes to max_length=255" style="width=50%" %}

Also, in `0052_auto_20170609_1902.py` and `models.py` I changed the `max_length` of `langauge = models.Charfield` to `max_length=25`. This is also to account for the differences in string length.  

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/pcari_sql_blog_post/change-max-length2.png" description="Change all the max_length attributes to max_length=25" style="width=50%" %}

Finally, in `0049_model_refactor.py`, I changed the `default=0` value to `default=None` because MySQL complains when you have a `default=0` attribute on a `ForeignKey`. 

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/pcari_sql_blog_post/change-default.png" description="Change all the default=0 attributes to default=None" style="width=50%" %}

## A Note
If your migration fails, you may need to do some debugging. Every case may be different, so I cannot give much advice here, unfortunately. However, if you want to retry a migration after making some changes, you will need to start with an empty database. To do that, we will `DROP` the database and create a new one. To do so:
```mysql
mysql> DROP DATABASE pcari;
mysql> CREATE DATABASE pcari CHARACTER SET UTF8;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pcari.* TO root@localhost;
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> QUIT
```
Then, you can try the migration again. Ok, lets begin!

The details are all abstracted away for you, so all you need to do is run:
```bash
$ python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```
Do not run `makemigrations`, as Jonathan as written up a custom migration.

Finally, to load all the data from the old database, we checkout our git `HEAD` to an older commit, get a data dumpfile from that older `db.sqlite3` file, and then switch back to our current commit. Here are the steps to doing so:
```bash
$ git checkout cc83f886101a96369cae20796f0433759b4a9ada  # This is the README update commit on `master` (using SQLite)
$ python2 manage.py dumpdata --natural-primary --natural-foreign > data.json
$ git checkout your_working_branch  # Go back to the latest commit on your working branch with the MySQL configuration
$ python2 manage.py loaddata data.json
```

You should see a message like 
```bash
Installed 9522 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)
```

-------------

# Step 7: Wrap Up
And that's it! Now you have transitioned your webapp from SQLite to MySQL. While SQLite is quick, reliable, and useful for most development purposes, when your app transitions into production you often need to transition your backend database to fill the needs. And with this tutorial, you now know how!
