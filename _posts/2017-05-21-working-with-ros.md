This article is a quickstart tutorial on how to use [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), short for Robot Operating System. Since the creators can describe it much better than I can, to give a description I am just going to lift a quote from the website: "It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms."

This tutorial will get the average user up and running with ROS!
 
### Prerequisites/Assumptions: 
- You have Python 2.7 installed, and know how to code in it
- You are using OS X
