This article is a quickstart tutorial on how to use [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), short for Robot Operating System. Since the creators can describe it much better than I can, to give a description I am just going to lift a quote from the website: "It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms."
